## Featuresッ
### Aloe Vera Plant
The Aloe Vera Plant rarely spawns in Savannas, Deserts and the Badlands-Biomes.
When right-clicked, it drops 2-4 Aloe Vera items, which can be used to craft Aloe Vera Gel.
When broken with shears, it rarely drops an additional Aloe Vera Offset, which can be used to re-plant.
### Aloe Vera Block
Aloe Vera Blocks can be crafted using 9 Aloe Vera Gel.
They also negate fall-damage and give the player Regeneration 1 for 3 seconds when inside the block.
### Peaceful Slime-Recipes
Aloe Vera Gel + Lime Dye = 1 Slime Ball
Aloe Vera Block + Lime Dye = 1 Slime Block
